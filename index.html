        <h2>Senior at Bob Jones</h2>
        
         <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying kinesiology. I currently work for the Greenville Triumph in their retail shop.</p>
         <p>
            I participate on the track and field team by throwing the hammer. I am originally from Carthage, NC and have served as a youth leader at my church back home.

         <p>
            Some hobbies I enjoy doing when I'm not studying is reading my favorite author Mitch Albom and painting/drawing. I also enjoy going out to a lake to fish.
